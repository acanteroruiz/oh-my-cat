The password is any password that meets the condition of balanced parentheses.

A sequence of characters is understood to be correctly balanced with respect to parentheses if each of the opening parentheses has its closed parentheses. When we add other grouping mechanisms (such as brackets, [ and ] or braces, { and }), the balance is given if the number of openings of each symbol matches the number of closings and they are also closed in the correct order.

Valid example: '({[]})()'
